2. Pseudocode and Implementation
Pseudocode
Initialize the Application

Import necessary libraries.
Set up the API base URL.
User Input

Prompt the user to input a region (country, state, or city).
Fetch COVID-19 Statistics

Construct the API request URL using the user input and API base URL.
Send a request to the COVID-19 statistics API and retrieve the data.
Process and Display Data

Extract relevant COVID-19 statistics from the API response.
Display the current number of cases, recoveries, and deaths for the specified region.
Implementation
Hereâ€™s the Python code implementing the above pseudocode:

python
Copy code
import requests

def get_covid_stats(region):
    base_url = "https://disease.sh/v3/covid-19"
    complete_url = f"{base_url}/all" if region.lower() == 'world' else f"{base_url}/countries/{region}"
    
    response = requests.get(complete_url)
    
    if response.status_code == 200:
        covid_data = response.json()
        return covid_data
    else:
        print("Error: Unable to fetch data. Please check the region and try again.")
        return None

def display_covid_stats(region, covid_data):
    if covid_data:
        print(f"COVID-19 Statistics for {region.capitalize()}:")
        print(f"Total Cases: {covid_data.get('cases', 'N/A')}")
        print(f"Total Recoveries: {covid_data.get('recovered', 'N/A')}")
        print(f"Total Deaths: {covid_data.get('deaths', 'N/A')}")
    else:
        print("No data available to display.")

def main():
    region = input("Enter the region (country or 'world' for global statistics): ")
    
    covid_data = get_covid_stats(region)
    display_covid_stats(region, covid_data)

if _name_ == "_main_":
    main()
3. Documentation of the API Integration
API Used: disease.sh COVID-19 API

API Endpoint:

Global statistics: https://disease.sh/v3/covid-19/all
Country-specific statistics: https://disease.sh/v3/covid-19/countries/{country}
Parameters:

country: The country for which COVID-19 statistics are requested (e.g., USA, India).
Response Format: JSON

Contains COVID-19 statistics such as total cases, recoveries, and deaths.
4. Explanation of Assumptions and Potential Improvements
Assumptions:

The user inputs a valid region (country name or 'world').
The API key is not required for the disease.sh API.
Potential Improvements:

Error Handling: Improve error handling for network issues and invalid inputs.
User Interface: Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) for better user experience.
Enhanced Statistics: Include additional statistics such as new cases, active cases, and vaccination data.
Regional Support: Expand support to more specific regions (e.g., states or cities) if the API provides such data.
Real-time Updates: Implement real-time data updates to provide continuous monitoring.
